[run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) generates the following two data sets in the following manner:

## final_data.csv
1. First activity labels (activity_id -> activity_name) are read from `UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt`.
2. Then, test and training data are fetched from `UCI HAR Dataset/<test/train>/X_<test/train>.txt` respectively.
  - Each record in these tables is enriched with activity names by first fetching activity ids for the records from `UCI HAR Dataset/<test/train>/y_<test/train>.txt`, transforming them to activity names and then enriching the rows with these activity names.
  - Each record is enriched with the subject ids for the records stored in `UCI HAR Dataset/<test/train>/subject_<test/train>.txt`.
3. The test and the train tables from #2 are merged row-wise into a single table.
4. The column names of the table from #3 are replaced with feature names stored in `UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt`.
5. Only columns containing the strings "mean()" or "std()" are retained from the table in #4 (details about the measurements can be found in `UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt`).
6. Column names of table in #5 are transformed to human readable names by converting "mean()" to "Mean" and "std()" to "STD" and getting rid of hyphens ("-").

The data table finally obtained from #6 is written to [final_data.csv](final_data.csv).

## final_data_aggregated.csv
Continuing from above, this data set is generated by taking the mean of each measurement in the table from #6 grouped at the (subject, activity) grain. This means that each row in this table contains the mean of each column in #6 (except, of course, the activity and subject columns) for a single (subject, activity) combination. For example, the following row:
```
"","subject","activity","tBodyAccMeanX","tBodyAccMeanY","tBodyAccMeanZ",...
"1",1,"LAYING",0.22159824394,-0.0405139534294,-0.11320355358,...
```
contains mean of each measurement for subject with ID "1" for the "LAYING" activity.

The data table obtained from this step is written to [final_data_aggregated.csv](final_data_aggregated.csv).
